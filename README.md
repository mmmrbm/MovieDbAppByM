# MovieDbAppByM
A WPF MVVM based movie catalog software for personal use.

This software is basically a MVVM version of https://sourceforge.net/projects/moviecentral/, with some UI changes. The original software is developed by https://sourceforge.net/u/sidtechster/profile/.

I have recreated the backend of the application using a layered architecture and conformed to patterns like repository, unit of work, DI whilst following WPF best practices. This was a good exercise as I could able to spend some time to research and learn the standards and few technicalities.

I am one of a good backend developer, but one of the worst UI / UX person in industry. Thus, UI can be improved a lot and I would really like some ideas from community.

This software is created by a movie enthusiast for other enthusiasts out there. This is free of cost and covered under [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
